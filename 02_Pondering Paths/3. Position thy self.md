Flag: `pwn.college{cyHltUJjWmdHG9lBSSGZKvzrUQK.QX2QTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge
/challenge/run
cd /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia
/challenge/run
```
### Solution:

First I navigated to the `challenge` directory and tried to run the program. It then gave me the correct directory in which I should run the program. So, I navigated to that directory and executed the program.

### What I Learned:
`cd command` is used to navigate through directories.
