## Position Elsewhere

### Objective: To learn about navigation through directories and absolute paths.

Flag: `pwn.college{ECVO7zAHJ9njiyULsBfRm1_wXJR.QX3QTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge
/challenge/run
cd /var/log
/challenge/run
```

### Solution:

First I navigated to the `challenge` directory and tried to run the program. It then gave me the correct directory in which I should run the program. So, I navigated to that directory and executed the program.
