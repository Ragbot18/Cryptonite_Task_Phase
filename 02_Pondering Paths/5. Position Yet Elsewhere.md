### Objective: To learn about navigation through the directories and executing programs.

Flag: `pwn.college{8aUxC4-AYjJ06304WJTzCwq2kf-.QX4QTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge
/challenge/run
cd /sys
/challenge/run
```

### Solution:

First I navigated to the `challenge` directory and tried to run the program. It then gave me the correct directory in which I should run the program. So, I navigated to that directory and executed the program.

### What I Learned: 
`cd` is used to navigate through directories.
