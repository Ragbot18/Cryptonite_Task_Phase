# Pondering Paths
## Implicit Relative Path

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{0xHYUcaTgk2I28k-_kMYN6ipPHz.QXxUTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge
./run
```

### Solution:

I navigated to the correct directory which contained the program and then used `'.'` to execute the program in the current directory.

### What I Learned: 

If we simply run our program(use a 'naked' path), Linux doesn't search for the program in the current working directory as a safety measure. This happens so that we can avoid executing programs in the current working directory which may have the same name as our computer's utilities. </br> 

Hence, we have to use `'.'` to explicitly tell linux to execute the program in the current directory.
