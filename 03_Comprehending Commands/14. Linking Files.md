# Comprehending Commands
## Linking Files

### Objective: To learn about linking files in Linux using different methods (Soft Link and Hard Link).

Flag: `pwn.college{4947kXe5fH2B73XBBAQc5NhalbZ.QX5ETN1wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag
/challenge/catflag
```

### Solution:

The task required us to link the file (not-the-flag) to the file actually containing the flag (/flag) as the program (/challenge/catflag) will read out the contents of not-the-flag file.

### What I Learned: 

We can links files in Linux in 2 ways: Hard Links and Soft Links

Hard Link: A duplicate reference to the same file which refers to the same inode(metadata). It doesn't break if original file is deleted.

Soft Link: A pointer to another file or directory. It stores the path to the target file instead of referencing to the same inode.

The 'file' command is used to identify the type of file. It can even identify links.
