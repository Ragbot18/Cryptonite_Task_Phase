# Digesting Documentation
## Reading Manuals

### Objective: To learn about manuals in Linux and how to access and read through them (man command.)

Flag: `pwn.college{gob7tKOdqe34jvNt2fRomAwCOCL.QX0EDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
man challenge
/challenge/challenge --gobtdq 734
```

### Solution:

Firstly, executed man command to display the manual of the challenge command. Then, read through the manual to find the correct usage of the program and its arguments. Finally, ran the program with the appropriate argument to retrieve the flag.

### Incorrect Tangent:

At first glance, didn't read the argument section and just executed the program with no argument.

### What I Learned: 

Learned how to read through complex manuals and find the correct usage of commands and its arguments.
