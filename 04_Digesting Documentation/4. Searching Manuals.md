# Digesting Documentation
## Searching Manuals

### Objective: To learn how to navigate and search through manuals.

Flag: `pwn.college{YwZeYUk7BTCrZIXrq2Lmqul0tF4.QX1EDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
man challenge
/challenge/challenge --cc
```

### Solution:

Displayed the manual of the challenge command and then searched through it using /flag function to find the correct argument. Then, executed the program with the appropriate argument to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

PgUp/PgDown keys can be used to navigate through the manual.

/ can be used to search with n to search for the next result and N to go to the previous result. ? can be used to search backwards.
