# Digesting Documentation
## Help for Builtins

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{MY9GzKr7z5onLwiino-zhAsC7sj.QX0ETO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
help challenge
challenge --secret MY9GzKr7

```

### Solution:

Invoked the builtin help command and then used the challenge command with the correct argument to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

A builtin is a command built into the shell itself (not a separate program)

The help command is used to give documentation for builtin commands only.
