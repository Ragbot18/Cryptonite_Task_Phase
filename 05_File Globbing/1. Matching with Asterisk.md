# File Globbing
## Matching with *

### Objective: To learn about the usage of * character in Linux terminal.

Flag: `pwn.college{cEtJzAel68SR93Nv6f7fgKmYsHy.QXxIDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /ch*
/challenge/run
```

### Solution:

Navigated to the challenge directory by only using 4 characters(using `*`) and then exectued the program to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

`*` is trated as a wildcard by the shell. It tries to replace the argument by any files that match the pattern.

`*` doesn't match with `'/'` or a leading `'.'`
