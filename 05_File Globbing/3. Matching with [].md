# File Globbing
## Matching with []

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{USJK2GcNybQXiSiG76_0g0tpHz3.QXzIDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge/files
/challenge/run file_[absh]
```

### Solution:

First, navigated to the /challenge/files directory and then executed the program with the appropriate argument using `[]`.

### What I Learned: 

`[]` are basically a subset of `?`. They also match with one character at a time but only to those characters mentioned inside the brackets.
