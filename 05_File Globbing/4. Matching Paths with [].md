# File Globbing
## Matching Paths with []

### Objective: To learn application of [] in paths.

Flag: `pwn.college{IgWfsjSIEnZybJL9cAN8lY-xEnD.QX0IDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[absh]
```

### Solution:

Had to access the files inside the `/challenge/files` directory without actually going there using absolute paths and file globbing.
