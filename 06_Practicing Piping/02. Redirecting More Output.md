# Practicing Piping
## Redirecting More Output

### Objective: To learn we can use > to force output of different commands into a file.

Flag: `pwn.college{MBIdYlMfGDVH30-NlRSJASVLUhl.QX1YTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run > myflag
cat myflag
```

### Solution:

I ran the /challenge/run program and redirected its stdout to myflag file as asked. Then, printed the file to retrieve the flag.

### What I learned:

/challenge/run redirects only the flag to stdout and still prints the instructions (stderr) in the terminal.
