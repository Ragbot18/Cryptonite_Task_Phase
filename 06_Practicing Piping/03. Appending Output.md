# Practicing Piping
## Appending Output

### Objective: To learn how to append output into a file.

Flag: `pwn.college{c7xXSWo1u6HV8rMZBpY897byKa3.QX3ATO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run >> the-flag
cat the-flag
```

### Solution:

Used `>>` to append the output of /challenge/run into the-flag file. Then, read the file to retrieve the flag.


### What I Learned:

We can use `>>` instead of `>` which appends output into the file instead of overwriting the file.
