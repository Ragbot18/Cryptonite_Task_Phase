# Practicing Piping
## Redirecting Input

### Objective: To learn how to redirect input using <.

Flag: `pwn.college{s2vzB48VBLqbO4b22s_Q5DSny4L.QXwcTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
echo COLLEGE > PWN
/challenge/run < PWN
```

### Solution:

First, I redirected the output of echo command to PWN (basically wrote COLLEGE into PWN file) and then redirected PWN file as an input to /challenge/run program to retrieve the flag.

### What I learned:

`<` is used to redirect stdin to a command.

`<` = `0>`
