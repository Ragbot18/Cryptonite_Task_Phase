# Practicing Piping
## grepping Stored Results

### Objective: To learn how to use grep on a file which contains the redirected output and retrieve the flag.

Flag: `pwn.college{Q3rjQR_4qPi52-ag74vOoiWDApD.QX4EDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt
grep "pwn.college" /tmp/data.txt
```

### Solution:

First, I redirected the output of `/challenge/run` to the file `/tmp/data.txt` and then searched through the file using the `grep` command (searching for `"pwn.college"` as it is common to all flags) to retrieve the flag.
