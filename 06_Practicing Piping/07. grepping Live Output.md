# Practicing Piping
## grepping Live Output

### Objective: To learn how to grep(search) in a live output.

Flag: `pwn.college{YHchOHY4z26IfcL9e9HlLZbYthw.QX5EDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run | grep "pwn.college"
```

### Solution:

I used the pipe operator to directly feed the output of the program as input into the grep command as required and retrieved the flag.

### What I learned:

`|` is a pipe operator. The pipe operator takes the output (stdout) of one command and feeds it as input (stdin) to another command.
