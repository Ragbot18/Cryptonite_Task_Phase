# Practicing Piping
## Grepping Errors

### Objective: To learn how to grep through errors.

Flag: `pwn.college{QnyKdoWuf8WZdlpDfuwU7RoK-Lj.QX1ATO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run 2>& 1 | grep "pwn.college"
```

### What I Learned: 

The shell has a >& operator, which redirects a file descriptor to another file descriptor.
