# Practicing Piping
## Grepping Errors

### Objective: To learn how to grep through errors.

Flag: `pwn.college{QnyKdoWuf8WZdlpDfuwU7RoK-Lj.QX1ATO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run 2>& 1 | grep "pwn.college"
```

### Solution: 

As `|` only redirects stdout to another command, we first have to redirect our stderr (FD2) to stdout (FD1) using `>&` and then pass it to the grep command to search through it and retrieve the flag.


### What I Learned: 

The shell has a >& operator, which redirects a file descriptor to another file descriptor.

`|` only redirects stdout to another command. There is no `"2|"` operator to redirect stderr.
