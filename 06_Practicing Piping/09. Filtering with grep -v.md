# Practicing Piping
## Filtering with grep -v

### Objective: To learn how to filter through outputs using `grep -v`.

Flag: `pwn.college{YS0JP49uKwuGAOqsMAwMuZLTE7O.0FOxEzNxwiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run | grep -v "DECOY"
```

### Solution:

Used the pipe operator to redirect the live output of the `challenge/run` program to the grep command and used `-v` (Invert Match) to filter out all the DECOY flags and retrieve the actual flag.

### What I Learned: 

`-v`: Invert Match

Normal grep shows lines that match a pattern, `grep -v` shows lines that don't match a pattern.
