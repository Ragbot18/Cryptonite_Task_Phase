# Practicing Piping
## Duplicating Piped Data with tee

### Objective: To learn how to duplicate piped data using tee command.

Flag: `pwn.college{IB_pmi6xgZ1TJ1JChG5rDRtmjom.QXxITO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/pwn | tee intercept.txt | /challenge/college
cat intercept.txt
/challenge/pwn --secret IB_pmi6x | /challenge/college
```

### Solution:

Firstly, I redirected the output of `/challenge/pwn` and intercepted it using `tee` to write the output into `intercept.txt` file, while also redirecting the output to `/challenge/college` program. Then, read the `intercept.txt` file to get the secret code and use it finally retrieve the flag.

### Incorrect Tangents:

Intially, I tried `/challenge/pwn | tee /challenge/college` and failed to realize that tee is used to write the output to a file and can't give input to a program.

### What I Learned: 

The `tee` command duplicates data flowing through your pipes to any number of files provided on the command line and also displays the output on the terminal.
