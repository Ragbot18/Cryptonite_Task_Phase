# Practicing Piping
## Process Subsititution for Input

### Objective: To learn how to compare the output of two files without saving them.

Flag: `pwn.college{wXSAU1u9FVMPtF5_fYCI6sell_V.0lNwMDOxwiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
```

### Solution:

`diff` doesn't accept command outputs as arguments, it needs file paths as arguments. So, I used process substitution to redirect the command output as files to argument to the `diff` command to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

Process substitution lets us treat the output (or input) of a command as if it were a file. 

When we write `<(command)`, the terminal runs the command and hooks up its output to a temporary file that it creates. This isn't a real file and is called a **named pipe**.

`diff` requires 2 file paths as arguments and output of a command can't be directly given as an argument. So, we can use process substitution to treat the command output as a file.
