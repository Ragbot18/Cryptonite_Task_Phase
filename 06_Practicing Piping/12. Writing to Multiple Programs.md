# Practicing Piping
## Writing to Multiple Programs

### Objective: To learn how to write the standard output of one command to two other commands directly without copying it using tee and process susbstition.

```
/challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
```

### Solution:

I used the pipe operator and the tee command with process substitution to write the stdout of `/challenge/hack` as stdin to both `/challenge/the` and `/challenge/planet`.

### What I Learned:

We can use the tee command along with process substitution to write the stdout of one command as stdin to different commands simultaneously. 

If we give `>(command)` as argument, the terminal runs the command (this command reads data from standard input, performs its function and writes it to standard output), but hooks up its input to a temporary pipe file. When commands write to this file, the data goes to the standard input of the command.
