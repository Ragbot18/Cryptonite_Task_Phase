# Practicing Piping
## Named Pipes

### Objective: To learn how to create a FIFO and then inputting and reading from it at the same time.

Flag: `pwn.college{EhksS2zV2n0mKAY2_rEJFL9g22A.01MzMDOxwiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo
/challenge/run > /tmp/flag_fifo

**IN A DIFFERENT TERMINAL**
cat /tmp/flag_fifo 
```

### Solution:

In the first terminal, I first created a FIFO and then reidrected stdout of `/challenge/run` to it. Then, in another terminal used `cat` to read the FIFO so that it is ready in both read and write mode.

### What I Learned: 

We can create our own FIFO using `mkfifo`. We can only operate on them when they are open in both read and write mode.
