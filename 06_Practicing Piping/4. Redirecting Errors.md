# Practicing Piping
## Redirecting Errors

### Objective: To learn how to redirect errors.

Flag: `pwn.college{A1cwei573cNn6zH9sZuRNk5bPJ7.QX3YTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions
cat myflag
```

### Solution:

We have to redirect the flag which is the output (FD1) to myflag and the error/instructions from FD2 to instructions

### What I Learned: 

File descriptors: FD0 is the stdin, FD1 is stdout and FD2 is stderr. We can specify the channel's output we want to write onto the file by specifying the number before > like 1> will write the output onto the file and so on.
