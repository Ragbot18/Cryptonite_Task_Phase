# Shell Variables
## Setting Variables

### Objective: To learn how to assign value to variables.

Flag: `pwn.college{sr5n9B7re6208hF9KZekcei1HQP.QX5UTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
PWN=COLLEGE
```

### Solution:

Just assigned the value `COLLEGE` to the variable `PWN` to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

We can use `=` to assign values to variables. 

There should be no space between the variable and value otherwise the shell will consder the variable as a command.
