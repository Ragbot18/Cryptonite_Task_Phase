# Processes and Jobs
## Interuppting Processes

### Objective: To learn how to interrupt processes in the terminal.

Flag: `pwn.college{8FmNT6o-CF8LlIwwIG2FzPkfC5z.QXzQDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run
^C
```

### Solution:

`/challenge/run` is contantly running and we need to stop it to retrieve the flag. I used `Ctrl+C` to interrupt it and retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

`Ctrl+C` can be used to interrupt processes in the terminal.
