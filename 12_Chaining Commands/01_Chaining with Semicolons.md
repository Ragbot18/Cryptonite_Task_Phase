# Chaining Commands
## Chaining with Semicolons

### Objective: To learn how to chain commands with a `;`.

Flag: `pwn.college{gfKeentlwlwcu9Qq7BDvP0kk_t6.QX1UDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
```

### Solution:

- Used a `;` to chain the commands `/challenge/pwn` and `/challenge/college` and retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

A `;` can be used to chain commands in a command line which executes them one after the other.
