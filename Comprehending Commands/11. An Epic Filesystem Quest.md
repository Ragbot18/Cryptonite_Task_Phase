# Comprehending Commands
## An Epic Filesystem Quest

### Objective: To apply our knowledge of ls, cat and cd commands and navigate through clues to retrieve the flag.

Flag: `pwn.college{s1eimRwCcZNdE_1hM8rR_sedRwp.QX5IDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
Commands provided as screenshot.
```

### Solution: 

#### Navigated to the home directory and used ls to list all the files. Then, executed the required file to find the next hint. Continued this process of navigating through directories and sometimes listing (including hidden files) and reading out files without using cd command for **trapped clues** and sometimes with cd command for **delayed clues** to finally retrieve the flag.

### Incorrect Tangents

#### Did not read instructions in the file properly and executed cd command while trying to retrieve a **trapped clue**.
