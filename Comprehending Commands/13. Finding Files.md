# Comprehending Commands
## Finding Files

### Objective: To learn about the find function to search for files.

Flag: `pwn.college{gcKJ-1RmnSOP97Ax3O5jY6BT4hg.QXyMDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
find / -name flag -type f
cat /usr/share/javascript/mathjax/unpacked/jax/output/SVG/fonts/Asana-Math/Monospace/Regular/flag
```

### Solution:

Used the find command in the root directory while specifying file name flag and type as a file to get the required path to the flag file. Finally, reading the flag file to retrieve the flag.

### Incorrect Tangents: 

I was trying to use the find command without specifying the name, type or location which led to errors.

### What I Learned: 

flag command is used to search for files. We can specify the search location, type of file and name of file to search for.

find [search location] -name [name of file] -type [type of file]

If no arguments are given, it searches in the current working directory.
