# Comprehending Commands
## Comparing Files

### Objective: To learn about the diff command.

Flag: `pwn.college{kd5ECZIZxVekv0o1zydUdS_MPvA.01MwMDOxwiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
diff /challenge/decoys_only.txt /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt
```

### Solution:

Used the diff command to compare the given two files using absolute paths.

### What I Learned: 

The diff command compares two files line by line and shows us exactly what is different between them.

a --> add </br>
c --> change </br>
d --> delete

3c2 means line 3 in fle 1 should be replaced by line 2 in file 2.
