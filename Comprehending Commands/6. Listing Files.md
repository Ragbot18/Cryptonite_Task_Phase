# Comprehending Commands
## Listing Files

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{UxOQ86CN0rvEMQ-z3vUbG7ldgjH.QX4IDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge
ls
/challenge/3452-renamed-run-588
```

### Solution:

Firstly, navigated to the challenge directory and then listed all the files inside it to find the correct file name. Finally, executed that file to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

ls is used to list out all the files in the directory provided to it as argument. It will refer to the current working directory if no argument is given.
