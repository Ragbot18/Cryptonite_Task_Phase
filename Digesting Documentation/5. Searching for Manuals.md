## Searching for Manuals

### Objective: To learn how to search through the manual of the man page.

Flag: `pwn.college{4wX9hid6hQKUAOntPEI90eGo2ri.QX2EDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
man man
man -k challenge
/challenge/challenge --whidhn 496
```

### Solution:

Read through the manual of the man command and searched for specific argument to use to find the hidden manpage for challenge command. Then, used -k argument to search for challenge keyword in all the manpages. Finally, read the hidden manpage to find the program and its argument to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

man man command can be used to read the manual of the man command itself.
