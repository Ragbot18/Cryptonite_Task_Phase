# File Globbing
## Matching with ?

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{k2qMgyV0AFAKJUiEjuGzu1QgIHH.QXyIDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /?ha??enge
/challenge/run
```

### Solution:

Used ? in the argument to represent 'c' and 'l' as asked and then executed the program in the directory to retrieve the flag.

### What I Learned: 

? also works like * but only matches with one character at a time. Mutliple ?? can be used to represent a pattern.
