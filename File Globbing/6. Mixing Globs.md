# File Globbing
## Mixing Globs

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{Qw-PN-wSy_c1K00bcD8fq05PAzf.QX1IDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge/run
/challenge/run [cep]*
```

### Solution:

By putting the starting letters in the [], we filtered through all the files.

### Incorrect Tangents:

Tried many different combinations with mutiple globs first but later realized we had to put the initial letter in the [].

### What I Learned: 

We can mix different globs ([] and *) to filter files.
