# Pondering Paths
## Explicit Relative Paths, from /

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{cprvDECE90V4joD3vmaeqJg3s6u.QXwUTN0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
cd /
./challenge/run
```

### Solution:

Firstly, navigated to the parent directory and then used relative path, using '.' to refer to the cwd, to execute the program.

### What I Learned: 

'.' refers to the current working directory and doesn't move us to any other directory.
