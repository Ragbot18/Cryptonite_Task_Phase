# Pondering Paths
## Home Sweet Home

### Objective: 

Flag: `pwn.college{wn9oHYDyZw6dhqHuvz7VBsDrUu0.QXzMDO0wiM1EzNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run ~/f
```

### Solution:

I followed the constraints of the program - used an absolute path as the argument, the path was inside the home directory and the pre-expansion argument was 3 characters long. This created a file in the home directory and gave the flag.

### What I Learned: 

~ is a shortcut for our home directory. </br>

~/ ~ expands to home/user/~ as only the leading ~ is expanded in a statement. </br>

cd uses our home directory as the default destination (if no argument is provided).
